RT xe2x80x9c@jonlovett: If Mayans were good at predicting the future, there\\'d be Mayans.xe2x80x9d\" b\\'On a lighter note, the RHCP are f* awesome.

Fear of being shot may play a role:   b\\'Sam Harris also wrote a nice piece on the awesomeness of Hitchens:  May the good man RIP.\\' b\\'Read \"Lying\", the new book by my friend Sam Harris.
