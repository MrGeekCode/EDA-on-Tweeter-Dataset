# EDA-on-Tweeter-Dataset
In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on data set of Elon Musk Tweets which i got from data.world.
I calculated and plotted polarity, length , total no. of words, Average Length of each tweet after performing pre-processing. 
All the above mentioned tasks has been performed using Jupyter Notebook with python 3.0.
Anyone welcome with their suggestion of any improvement.
